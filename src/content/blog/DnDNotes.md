Grew up in Sanctified district

^^ has its own private guard, funded by nobles, very strict on laws

May need a proof of residence to get in, or a letter from a noble, or proof of business
 - Could try and cross the river

Church has a tense relationship with the nobles

Nobility is pretty secretive, afraid of the Church's wrath

Gladitorial fights in Sanctified district, maybe I snuck off to fight in one

Becoming a Jaeger made a transformation to my body, I don't remember the experience that caused it to take place, two hearts
